You , the reader and I are closer than ever before in human history.
Only  constraints  are your internet speed and the render time of this site.

What we know of each other is more or less the same. We share the experience of being human.
To read , to write , to speak , to share information are some more things we might have in common. 
We both have a rough idea of what's happening in the world at the moment. Our interpretations may vary , though , and its alright as long as we get the general idea.
What we know as knowledge is stored away in the next tab. What we both don't know might be stored there or is waiting to be uploaded.

We both are made of the same content. What we create is also similar,content that a human  is capable of creating. 
In OOP terms, We are all instances of the same class, constructed with different parameters and destructed eventually. 

And we are getting closer to each other. 

Faster internet speeds , increased coverage , increased translation features emerge as I type.

Much more innovation may happen before you can read this.

By the time you read this,
Hope what we think aligns on a way never seen before.
Hope the conditions we live in match.
Hope our differences dissolve away in the stream of time.
Hope we both be kinder to each other and to others of our kind.

Hope you and I would be the same one day.
